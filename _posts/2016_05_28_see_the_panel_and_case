title: Housing for WIRELESS AMPLIFIER
---

## WHY HOUSING

Actually I believe case is not a matter for DIY project, I really want this toy can be played with by friend have no interest in EE. I spent days on thinking, designing, drawing,,, and below please see my boards and case

<div class='message'>
this is for wireless AMPLIFIER
I revised the priority and now focus amplifier
will do cheap but high quality. will use the the sample amplifier chip as SONOS does --> STA339BW
will support 192K
will have good MCLK, low jitter
