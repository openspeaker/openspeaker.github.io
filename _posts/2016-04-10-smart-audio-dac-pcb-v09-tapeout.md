## Delay and delay... ,, spec changed

I worked fast on this spare time project during CNY vacation, but whenever the vacation finished, the project stalled. all my spare time occupied by the company's new project and new customer. and I have no time to survey, study, think on my DAC project.

when I reviewed my blogging, I saw the delay. I am just not happy with this situation, so I re-start the project. for speeding up all this, I removed STA339BW amplifer part and removed FL stamp hole board compatibility, after devotedly worked in two weekends. I sent the first PCB to manufacturing. :D
