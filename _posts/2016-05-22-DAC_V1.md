## Software mode need extra wiring to linkit and Raspberry Pi

I engjoy music with this board in very basic configuration, not tuning the driver for 24bit 192K yet. play the 'SD' quality audio will hear the different with WM8960, much much clean and clear, noise free. also the OP part was not fine tuned yet.

After checking the datasheet and learned that software config mode need extra wiring singles. so.. new board or modify the current board? fast answer is to modify the exist board. but I also want better compatible with Raspberry PI in mechanical(the exist one can not align well in the board boards). I speet a weekend on modification the schematic, drawing, another weekend on assembling,, and below you see the V1 board.
