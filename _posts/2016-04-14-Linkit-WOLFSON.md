## it works!

The fast PCB back and spent two nights on assembling, checking, debugging, fixing... it played sound this evening.

The sound is basically good and clear, noise free. for now 44.1KHz only and Linkit Smart first. let me think about next in the wonderful music. let me think about DSD with Raspberry Pi ....


I am really happy on this. :D
